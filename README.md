t## Hey, I'm Chris 👋

🎧 Professional Audio wizard, studio manager and immersive sound professional. For the last few years, I've mixed and mastered thousands of Dolby Atmos productions for a broad variety of high-profile clients and artists in my role as the head engineer at [ThreeDee Music](https://www.threedeemusic.com/).

👨‍💻 Code is my side hustle.

TLDR: I plan, build and run music studios, work on epic records with many amazing artists and solve workflow puzzles with code.

## Tech Stack
Node.js, React, Next.js, Python

Over the years, I have developed various APIs and workflow helpers, complex workflow automations and the like to increase productivity, quality and efficiency in daily studio workflows. I've also helped shape a few great audio plugins as an audio consultant to the amazing development team at [HOFA-Plugins](https://hofa-plugins.de/) as part of my role as senior engineer and Head of Studios at [HOFA-Studios](https://hofa-studios.de/).

🚀 Product Lead at ThreeDee Music, where we dropped [ThreeDee PRO](https://apps.apple.com/at/app/threedee-pro/id1584653537) the mobile app for artists & music pros to approve their Dolby Atmos mixes just like they’ll sound on Apple Music (incl. headtracking and all).
